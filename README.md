# CryptoLib

Provide a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station.

In order to build crypto the following must be installed assuming Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:
* `sudo apt install libgpg-error-dev:i386 libgcrypt20-dev:i386`


More information about building and usage of CryptoLib can be found within the repository Wiki:
